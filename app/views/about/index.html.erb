          <p>
            After running ProcurementExpress.com for 10 years, James Kennedy, the CEO, realized he needed to establish a newsletter to connect with his audience. But there was a problem – as James describes it, he was "the wrong type of nerd." He needed actual experts in SMB operations and finance.
